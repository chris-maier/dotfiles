# dotfiles

These are my personal linux dotfiles currently switching from Vim to Emacs and Evil mode.  

Inspired by Aaron Bieber there is a linkall.sh script which allows you to keep the workspace out of your home directory.

If you have a suggestion how to improve things please file a pull request and I am happy to look into it.
